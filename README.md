# Guess My Color RGB - A free RGB based color guessing game

# About : 
Death By RGB is for people like me who keep forgetting color combinations.

# Languages and Specs: 
HTML, CSS, Vanilla Script(JS)

# Mechanism:
RGB is generated in random order using Math.Random and allocated to Div containers.
Click events are handled using Java Script event.
The color fade in and fade out is added by JS handler by replacing CSS class in the Div item.
Animation fades away, fade is done using CSS. Note 1: The color combination is generated in real time hence no color is stored in any array or list. Note 2: The whole code is well documented hence you can change as per your need.
